# the-bot

This is the code for a bot that provides solution to the problem of reconstruction of damaged property in a disaster. The construction site is abstracted as graph, the path as black line and the construction material as the blocks of different color. There can be two types of house Low rise and high rise.

The user will give input and tell which house(upto 6 houses at once) needs which construction material(2 materials per house). The input can be given in the form of array in input section. The bot will automatically calculate the shortest path to construction material, will pick it up using designed and coded arm, go to the construction site and will supply the material there. 
The process will be repeated automatically till the requirement of each house is satisfied.
